Let's start first with some context, why am I writing this post?

I work at [Fourthline](https://www.fourthline.com/), a company that manages the KYC (Know Your Customer) process of companies like Revolut, TradeRepublic, N26. <br>
For who doesn't know what KYC is, think of when you have to register online to use the services provided from one of these companies and you have to take a selfie and a picture of your ID document to show you're who you claim you're. <br>
That's KYC in a nutshell, and as you may understand, we don't want to let fraudsters in.

If you ever played [Papers, Please](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papers,_Please) you can imagine that sometimes it's not super easy. <br>
