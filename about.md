First of all, thank you for visiting my blog!
It's just a very modest website where I share random thoughts and ideas that I feel like writing about.

I'm Davide, an Italian AI engineer currently working in Amsterdam. 
I started being interested into programming when I was little, around 11 years old. I feel like people that start coding at that age do it for mainly two reasons: creating videogames or becoming an hacker. In my case, it was the former. I was very much into videogames like many other kids and I wanted to create some of my own. I always had kind of a creative mindset, I remember that I also tried to start writing a book at the same time, a very bad copy of Eragon.

Anyway, this passion for videogames led me to learn many programming languages and to study Computer Engineering later on, where I discovered artificial intelligence and computer vision, which brought me to my current career. 
I am also continuing writing fiction in my free time and do many other things, depending on the obsession of the moment. 

Feel free to contact me for anything, even for a nice chat!
