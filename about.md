First of all, thank you for visiting my blog! <br>
It's just a very modest website where I share random thoughts and ideas that I feel like writing about.

I'm Davide, an Italian AI engineer currently working in Amsterdam. <br>
I started being interested in programming when I was little, around 11 years old. I have the idea that people who start coding at that age do it for mainly two reasons: creating video games or becoming a hacker. In my case, it was the former. I was very much into video games like many other kids, and I wanted to create some of my own. I always had a creative mindset; I remember that I also tried to start writing a book at the same time, a very bad copy of Eragon.

Anyway, this passion for video games led me to learn many programming languages and to study Computer Engineering later on, where I discovered artificial intelligence and computer vision, which brought me to my current career. <br>
I am also continuing to write fiction in my free time and do many other things, depending on the obsession of the moment.

Feel free to contact me for anything, even just for a nice chat!
